Responses to Essential Questions:

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?

User needs were interpreted through detailed discussions with the client and transformed into actionable user stories by the Product Owner. These stories guided the development efforts, ensuring that each feature developed was directly tied to user expectations and business objectives.
2. How do I approach developing programs?

My approach to program development is highly iterative and feedback-oriented, characteristics central to Agile methodologies. I plan to continue employing Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily scrums, and retrospectives to maintain flexibility, enhance productivity, and ensure continuous improvement.
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member involves more than fulfilling one's technical role; it requires active participation in team activities, effective communication, and a willingness to assist others. Emphasizing transparency, accountability, and mutual support are crucial for the success of any software development project.
Conclusion: The SNHU Travel application project underscored the value of the Scrum-Agile framework in managing complex software development projects. The project not only met the client's needs but also provided the team with invaluable insights into the dynamics of Agile project management.
